    I live in a city name Shafter and have attended several schools along the way. For elemantry I had attended Redwood Elemantry.
    For middle school, I attended Richland Junior High, which I made majority of my friends there. Now I am attending Shafter 
    High School and I am a senior. I will be class of 2026. Throughout my high school years I have tried to involve myself with 
    clubs and sports. I have been in college bound, Mecha, Link crew, and Trio. As for sports my freshman and sophmore year I joined
    soccer. Sophmore year I had joined tennis and track. For soccer I had been voted JV soccer captain. Moving on to Junior Year 
    I had been moved to varsity Tennis, and I dropped soccer. Howver I still continued to do Track. Now in my final year I 
    am currently doing tennis, and I am planning to continue with Track.
